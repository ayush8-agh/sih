📡 ESP-NOW Sender Module

This project demonstrates how to use ESP-NOW communication to send data from one ESP32/ESP8266 device (Sender) to another (Master/Receiver).
The sender periodically transmits sensor or status data wirelessly to the master without requiring Wi-Fi or internet access.

🚀 Features

📶 ESP-NOW Communication – Low-power, peer-to-peer wireless protocol.

⚙️ No Internet Required – Works offline with direct ESP-to-ESP data exchange.

📊 Lightweight Data Transmission – Ideal for IoT or sensor networks.

🔋 Low Power Usage – Efficient communication for battery-powered devices.

🧠 Project Overview

Sender ESP → sends sensor or status data → Master ESP (Receiver)
Communication is handled using ESP-NOW protocol provided by Espressif SDK.

Example use cases:

Wireless sensor nodes

Remote data loggers

Distributed IoT systems

Mesh-based sensor communication
